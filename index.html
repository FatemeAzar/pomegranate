    <p>
      The pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub in
      the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, that grows between 5 and 10
      m (16 and 33 ft) tall.The fruit is typically in season in the Northern
      Hemisphere from October to February,and in the Southern Hemisphere from
      March to May. As intact sarcotestas or juice, pomegranates are used in
      baking, cooking, juice blends, meal garnishes, smoothies, and alcoholic
      beverages, such as cocktails and wine. Pomegranates are widely cultivated
      throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, north and tropical Africa,
      Iran, the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, the drier parts of Southeast
      Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin.
